# logia
Logia is a sample implimentation of monitoring solution which uses push instead of pull for presenting metrices in realtime. 

the code is written in NodeJs using the Meteor Framework and MongoDB as a Backend TimeSeries Database. 

Mongo is not by nature a TSDB but the current architecture is tweeking the design to be used in such a way.
